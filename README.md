# UFO

## Analysis:

The purpose of this challenge was to build a table using a data-stored JavaScript array.  And to create filters to make the table fully dynamic, and then place it into an HTML file for easier viewing.  We built a customized webpage with Bootstraps and equipped the table with several functional filters that will allow any user to interact with our visualizations.

## Results:

Once a user enters the webpage, you will see a basic title with a picture at the top.  As they scroll down, they will see the data and filters that were programmed and coded into the Visual Studio Code.  The image below shows the filters a user can choose from City, State, Country, and Shape.  A user can make their search easier, use the filter search, and narrow down the places where there was a sighting of a UFO.

## Summary:

When we the user first opens the webpage, it looks very nice, with the dark lighting and the picture of the earth in the background of the title.  It alludes to the mysterious UFO sightings, is there or isn’t there?  It gets the user thinking.  And the table does have promising data, with locations and comments.  The only problem with the webpage is that the date is fixated on the year 2010.  And when pressing the clear filter button, it doesn’t clear the search for all of the filters, the user has to manually go to each filter and clear the section.
